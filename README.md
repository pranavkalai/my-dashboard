# Business Dashboard (Full-Stack Project)

This is a full-stack web application I'm building to help manage and visualize data for a family-run business. 
This project is also meant to help me learn how to use **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**, with the goal of eventually deploying it on **AWS**.
